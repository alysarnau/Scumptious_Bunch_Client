# FREELANCR README
 
## Pitch
 FREELANCR is the hottest new Freelancing Platform that will blow Fiverr out of the water. 

## Premise
This platform will allow Freelancers to create profiles and list their available services and price points. Users will be able to create profiles, log in, and view all available services, and sign up for them. It’s never been easier to get the services you need at the price you want.
